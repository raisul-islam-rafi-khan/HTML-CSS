        <p> Traffic jam is a situation in which a long line of vehicles on a road stops moving or moves slowly. It is created when there is a huge amount of vehicles on a road than its capacity. It is a common problem in all megacities around the world. In our country, Dhaka, Chattagram, Gazipur, Narayanganj, etc districts are seriously affected by traffic jams. Poor transport management, violation of traffic rules, lack of roads and highways, unplanned city, lack of coordination in development and maintenance works on the roads, etc are the causes of traffic jams. Where Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, its roads and highways have not been modernized according to the demand. Again with the increased population, the roads have become insufficient and cannot accommodate the large number of vehicles and their movements. Besides our cities aren’t built in an organized way which has made the roads narrowerer, too much zig-zag and several junctions in a small area.These problems create a mentality among the drivers and passengers to move the high traffic areas quickly. Thus, they cross vehicles violating traffic rules and the situation becomes more problematic. Many unplanned development works are done on the road, mismanagement, and lack of coordination among Govt. departments also lead to huge pain and suffering for the common people on the roads. We face traffic jams not only at a specific busy time, rather it is seen all day long both in the megacities and towns because of the carelessness of drivers and fitness-less public transport. Parking space is insufficient in the cities and the vehicles park alongside the roads and highways which shrinks the road making the situation worsen. A report published by the World Bank shows that the average traffic speed in Dhaka city is 4km/hour which is slower than the walking speed. For traffic jams, life in the city has turned into horrible nightmares. The movement of vehicles in big cities has become almost impossible. Many people fail to attend their office on time which causes loss of important working hours. </p>
