        <p> Traffic Jam refers to a long line of vehicles on the road leading to a serious roadblock. It is a common feature of the major roads of Bangladesh. It is also seen in the town or even rural roads. There are some causes behind this Firstly, many drivers are ignorant of traffic rules while some deliberately violate traffic rules. This leads to a serious roadblock. Again, plying of various vehicles with different velocities causes traffic jams. The vehicles with high speed are sometimes blocked by vehicles with less speed. In, traffic jams are largely occurred due to thousands of rickshaws plying on the busy roads. Besides, sometimes water clogged on the road leads to traffic jams. Finally. poor driving, reckless parking alongside pavements, and unhealthy competition among drivers cause a traffic jam. I feel bored at the time of a traffic jam. It can be removed by maintaining traffic rules strongly as well as making drivers conscious about following these rules</p>
