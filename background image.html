	<p> When you’ve said everything you need to say about a topic, it’s time to end the paragraph. If the paragraph looks like it’s too long after you’ve said everything, consider breaking it up into separate topics and paragraphs for the sake of the reader. 
The best way to end a paragraph is to sum up the topic with all the new information from the support sentences. In the excerpt from Dracula, Stoker concludes with an overall impression of the Count from all the details listed in the previous sentences. 
However, it’s not always necessary to restate the topic, which can sometimes come across as padding. It’s equally viable to end a sentence stating one final piece of support. In these instances, it’s best to conclude with the piece of information that has the most profound effect, as with Northup’s excerpt. </p>
